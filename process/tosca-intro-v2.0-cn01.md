# Table of Contents
[[TOC will be inserted here]]

-------

<!-- Insert a "line rule" (three or more hyphens alone on a new line, following a blank line) before each major section. This is used to generate a page break in the PDF format. -->

# 1 Introduction

Introductory material.

## 1.1 One way to produce OASIS-formatted HTML from Markdown

Here is a customized command line which will generate HTML from this markdown file (named tosca-intro-v2.0-cn01.md):

pandoc -f gfm -t html tosca-intro-v2.0-cn01.md -c styles/markdown-styles-v1.8a-cn.css --toc --toc-depth=5 -s -o tosca-intro-v2.0-cn01.html --metadata title="Introduction to TOSCA Version 2.0"

We are currently using pandoc 3.0 from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/3.0.

This also requires the presence of a .css file containing the HTML styles (like styles/markdown-styles-v1.8a-cn.css).

Note this command generates a Table of Contents (TOC) in HTML which is located at the top of the HTML document, and which requires additional editing in order to be published in the expected OASIS style. This editing can be handled by OASIS staff during publication. Alternatively, the TC may generate a TOC via other tools or processes.

## 1.2 Glossary

<!-- Optional section with suggested subsections -->

### 1.2.1 Definitions of terms

### 1.2.2 Acronyms and abbreviations

### 1.2.3 Document conventions

- Naming conventions
- Font colors and styles
- Typographic conventions

## 1.3 Some markdown usage examples

**Text.**

Note that text paragraphs in markdown should be separated by a blank line between them -

Otherwise the separate paragraphs will be joined together when the HTML is generated.
Even if the text appears to be separate lines in the markdown source.

To avoid having the usual vertical space between paragraphs,  
append two or more space characters, or a space followed by backslash (\\), to the end of the lines  
which will generate an HTML break tag instead of a new paragraph tag \
(as demonstrated here).

### 1.3.1 Figures and Captions

FIGURE EXAMPLE:
<note caption is best ABOVE figure, to allow a link to it to display image - same for table captions>

###### Figure 1 -- Title of Figure
![image-label should be meaningful](images/image_0.png) (this image is missing)

###### Figure 2 -- OpenC2 Message Exchange
![message exchange](images/image_1.png)


### 1.3.2 Tables

#### 1.3.2.1 Basic Table
**Table 1-1. Table Label**

| Item | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Item 1 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 2 | Something |
| Item 3 | Something<br>(second line) |
| Item 4 | text |

#### 1.3.2.2 Table with Three Columns and Some Bold Text
text.

| Title 1 | Title 2 | title 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| something | something | something else that is a long string of text that **might** need to wrap around inside the table box and will just continue until the column divider is reached |
| something | something | something |

#### 1.3.2.3 Table with a caption which can be referenced

###### Table 1-5. See reference label construction

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **content** | Message body as specified by content_type and msg_type. |

Here is a reference to the table caption:
Please see [Table 1-5 or other meaningful label](#table-1-5-see-reference-label-construction) 


### 1.3.3 Lists

Bulleted list:
* bullet item 1.
* **Bold** bullet item 2.
* bullet item 3.
* bullet item 4.

Indented or multi-level bullet list - add two spaces per level before bullet character (* or -):
* main bullet type
  * Example second bullet
    * See third level
      * fourth level

Numbered list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

### 1.3.4 Reference Label Construction

REFERENCES and ANCHORS
- in markdown source, format the Reference tags as level 6 headings like: `###### [OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0]`
###### [OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0]
_Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via HTTPS Version 1.0_. Edited by...

- reference text has to be on a separate line below the tag

- format cross-references (citations of the references) like: `see [[OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0](#openc2-https-v10)]`  
"see [[OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0](#openc2-https-v10)]"  
(note the outer square brackets in markdown will appear in the visible HTML text)

- The text in the Reference tag (following ###### ) will become an HTML anchor using the following conversion rules:
  - punctuation marks will be dropped (including "[" )
  - leading white spaces will be dropped
  - upper case will be converted to lower
  - spaces between letters will be converted to a single hyphen

- The same HTML anchor construction rules apply to cross-references and to section headings.
  - Thus, a section heading like "## 1.2 References"
  - becomes an anchor in HTML like `<a href="#12-references">`
  - referenced in the markdown like: see [Section 1.2](#12-references)
  - (in markdown: `"see [Section 1.2](#12-references"`)
  - similar HTML anchors are also used in constructing the TOC

### 1.3.5 Code Blocks

Text to appear as an indented code block with grey background and monospace font - use three back-ticks before and after the code block).

Note the actual backticks will not appear in the HTML version. If it's necessary to display visible backticks, place a back-slash before them like: \``` .

```
{   
    "target": {
        "x_kmip_2.0": {
            {"kmip_type": "json"},
            {"operation": "RekeyKeyPair"},
            {"name": "publicWebKey11DEC2017"}
        }
    }
}
```

Text to be highlighted as code can also be surrounded by a single "backtick" character: 
`code text`

## 1.4 Page Breaks
Add horizontal rule lines where page breaks are desired in the PDF - before each major section
- insert the line rules in markdown by inserting 3 or more hyphens on a line by themselves:  ---
- place these before each main section in markdown (usually "#" - which generates the HTML `<h1>` tag)

-------

# 2 Section Heading
text.

## 2.1 Level 2 Heading
text.

### 2.1.1 Level 3 Heading
text.

#### 2.1.1.1 Level 4 Heading
text.

##### 2.1.1.1.1 Level 5 Heading
This is the deepest level, because six # gets transformed into a Reference tag.


## 2.2 Next Heading
text.
